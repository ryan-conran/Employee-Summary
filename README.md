# project title: Employee Summary

# Installation instructions: To use this app a user must have visual studio code, and must also have node js installed to bring up an inquirer prompt in order to input employee information.  Users must also insure that they install the proper modules.

# Usage instructions: This app is designed to help provide employee information in a simple readable format via html. Managers, or other high up personnel must simply ansewer the question prompts that arise when they enter "node index.js" into their terminal, or GitBash (provided they are in the correct directory when running).  Once users have answered each of the prompts they will be asked on additional prompt to determine whether they would like to add an additional employee card.  Upon entering all of the required data an html file is written with each of the employee cards added on the page.  This html page is a useful reference and can be sent to other parties who require employee information.
